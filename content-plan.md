Great question — this is exactly the right moment to be **selective**, not additive.

I’ll answer in two parts:

1. **What to do with your current portfolio projects (keep / tweak / remove)**
2. **A concrete list of new content to add** (blogs, case studies, portfolio projects), each with a short description you can later expand into full content

Everything below is aligned with your **LinkedIn positioning, inbound strategy, and international clients**.

---

## 1. What to do with your current portfolio projects

### The rule to use (very important)

For every existing project, ask only this:

> “Does this project help a founder or operator understand how I reduce operational friction or make better automation decisions?”

If the answer is **no**, it’s either:

* a tweak
* or a removal

Your portfolio is not a résumé.
It’s **evidence for a buyer**.

---

### Categories of existing projects (how to treat them)

#### ✅ KEEP (but tweak the framing)

Keep projects that show:

* automation
* systems thinking
* integrations
* real-world constraints
* operational outcomes

**What to tweak**

* Rewrite descriptions away from *what you built*
* Toward *what problem existed + what changed*

**Example tweak**
Instead of:

> “Built an n8n workflow integrating X and Y”

Use:

> “Designed a workflow to eliminate manual coordination between X and Y, reducing follow-ups and execution errors.”

Same project.
Different signal.

---

#### ⚠️ KEEP BUT DOWNPLAY (move lower or mark as “experiments”)

Projects that are:

* technically interesting
* exploratory
* demos
* learning projects
* blockchain or AI experiments without clear ops impact

These can stay **if**:

* they are not dominant
* they are clearly framed as experiments or R&D

Rename the section:

> *Experiments & Explorations*

This protects credibility without confusing buyers.

---

#### ❌ REMOVE (or archive)

Strong recommendation to remove or hide:

* toy projects
* games
* pure technical demos
* unrelated blockchain experiments
* anything that looks like “I can build anything”

These attract:

* recruiters
* hobbyists
* low-budget clients

They dilute your consulting signal.

You can keep them on GitHub.
They don’t belong on the homepage portfolio.

---

### Ideal portfolio structure after cleanup

* **3–5 Featured Case Studies** (business-framed)
* **Optional: Experiments & Explorations** (collapsed / secondary)

That’s it.

---

## 2. New content to add — structured list (this is what you asked for)

Below is a **curated list of new content** to add over time.

Each item includes:

* title
* type
* purpose
* brief description

You can turn each one into a full piece later.

Technical exploration of agent-based systems with emphasis on safety, scope, and execution boundaries.

---

## Final guidance (important)

* **Remove noise first**
* Then add **signal slowly**
* You don’t need to publish everything at once
* 3–4 strong pieces beat 20 weak ones

If you want, next I can:

* help you **decide exactly which current projects to keep**
* turn **one case study into a full page**
* or write **one blog post end-to-end**

Just tell me what you want to tackle next.
