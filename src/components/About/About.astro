				I’m Nicolas, a software engineer and automation consultant focused on building systems that actually work in real operations.
                <br/><br/>
                Over the last decade, I’ve worked across engineering, automation, and complex technical environments, helping teams turn messy workflows into clear, reliable systems.
                <br/><br/>
                My work today sits at the intersection of software engineering, AI automation, and operational design. I help small teams and tech-enabled businesses reduce manual effort, improve consistency, and scale without introducing unnecessary complexity.
                <br/><br/>
                I’m not interested in hype or “AI for the sake of AI.” My focus is on practical automation — the kind that teams trust, maintain, and rely on every day.
                <br/><br/>
                If your operation feels heavier than it should, or if automation efforts haven’t delivered the clarity you expected, that’s usually where I can help.
