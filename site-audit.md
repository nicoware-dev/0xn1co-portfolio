# 📌 1. Current Site Audit — What’s Working & What’s Missing

### ✅ Good elements

* Clear hero title with your role and specialization
* Concise *About Me* introduction
* Technologies and services listed
* Portfolio section and projects
* Blog posts visible
* Contact and social links

### ❌ Areas that need improvement

**Clarity and positioning**

* Homepage headline is descriptive but not crafted for a *business buyer*
* No clear “Who I help + problem I solve” statement above the fold

**Trust & validation**

* No case studies with outcomes/results
* No testimonials or social proof

**Focus**

* Services are broad (AI automation + custom dev + blockchain)
* Hard to immediately understand what you *want to sell*, to *whom*

**Content consistency**

* Your blog posts date from 2024; none recent (less activity → less relevance for SEO)
* “Newsletter” sign up exists but unclear what subscribers get

**Experience presentation**

* Technical stack is listed, but not tied to *business results*

---

# 🎯 2. Strategic Rewrite + Website Improvement Plan (English)

Your site should:

* **Speak directly to your ideal client**
* **Demonstrate business value**
* **Convert visitors into conversations**
* **Reflect your LinkedIn positioning**
* **Be SEO-friendly & trust-building**([wix.com][1])

---

## 🧠 A. Homepage Rewrite (Above the Fold)

### Current:

> AI Automation & Agentic Systems Engineer
> Building agentic systems… intelligent workflows…

### Recommended (client-focused):

**Headline**

> I help small teams and tech-enabled businesses streamline operations, reduce manual work, and unlock strategic value through practical AI automation and custom software.

**Subheadline (optional)**

> Clear, business-aligned automation that adds predictability and reduces operational chaos.

**Why this works**

* Immediately tells *who you help*
* Shows *intermediate benefit* (streamline + reduce work)
* Implies *business outcomes* (value, predictability)([Artdez][2])

---

## 🧠 B. “About Me” Section — Rewrite

Right now it’s a technical bio. Let’s turn it into a **problem-solution story**.

**Suggested copy:**

> I’m Nicolas, a tech consultant with 10+ years building systems that deliver real operational value. I partner with small tech teams and business leaders who are frustrated by repetitive manual work, fragmented tools, and unreliable workflow execution.
>
> My approach isn’t about shiny AI demos — it’s about reducing complexity and delivering systems that work day-to-day. I combine deep engineering experience, practical automation, and strong architectural judgment to help teams scale without adding chaos.
>
> If your operation feels heavy, inconsistent, or too dependent on manual effort, we should talk.

**What to add**

* Your *why* (“I solve …”)
* A couple of *business outcome statements*
* A CTA button: **“Let’s talk about your challenge”**

This aligns with consulting portfolio best practice: *talk to the audience’s problems first*([LinkedIn][3]).

---

## 🧠 C. Services — Clarify & Client-Frame

Right now your Services section is too broad and a bit generic.

### Recommended structure

**Primary service (hero focus)**

* **AI-Driven Automation & Operational Systems**

  * Systems that reduce manual effort
  * Workflow automation
  * Multi-agent AI systems for business logic

**Secondary service (support)**

* **Custom Software Development**

  * Tailored solutions that solve specific operational needs

**Tertiary service (thought leadership)**

* **Consulting & Technical Strategy**

  * Strategic guidance, process assessment, architectural review

### Simplify copy like this for each service:

**AI Automation & Operational Systems**

> Reduce manual effort and operational bottlenecks with systems that are reliable, maintainable, and aligned with your business priorities.

**Custom Software Development**

> Built from the ground up to solve your unique tech challenges — web apps, backend systems, integrations.

**Consulting & Technical Strategy**

> Get clarity and alignment on your tech decisions before spending on tools or implementation.

This is more in line with how consulting buyers think about service categories([LinkedIn][3]).

---

## 🧠 D. Portfolio — Make Projects Business-Centric

Right now your portfolio shows categories but:

❌ No clear case studies
❌ No indication of outcomes

**What to add to each project**

* Client / business challenge
* What you *did*
* *Business outcome* (numbers where possible)
* Tools/stack used

**Template for project page**

> **Project Name**
> *Client industry / problem*
>
> **Challenge:**
> What was broken or inefficient?
>
> **Solution:**
> What you built and how it solved the problem
>
> **Impact:**
> Time saved / errors reduced / revenue impact / process improvement

This aligns with portfolio best practices for consultancy / client work([wix.com][1]).

---

## 🧠 E. Blog — Align with Search Intent + Expertise

Your blog shows generic tech posts (Node.js games, n8n hosting, etc.). These don’t support your consulting services.

### New content strategy:

Write posts that map to:

* business operational problems
* automation decision frameworks
* case study walkthroughs
* thought leadership (e.g., a post about OpenClaw as we drafted earlier)

This increases SEO relevance and client discovery([Artdez][2]).

---

## 🧠 F. Calls to Action

Right now you have **Request a Quote (Google Form)** on the nav, which feels transactional.

### Better CTAs

Primary:

> **Let’s talk about your challenge**
> Leads to contact page or email

Secondary:

> **See how automation could help you**
> Links to interactive tools (if integrated)

Avoid “quote” language — it makes you sound like a price bomber rather than solution partner.

---

## 🧠 G. Trust Signals to Add

Your site **needs** at least:

* Testimonials (even short sentences from past collaborators/clients)
* Case studies with measurable impact
* Logos of places you worked or projects

This is standard on consulting sites to establish credibility([Mad Mind Studios][4]).

---

## 🧠 H. Navigation & UX

Improve navigation clarity:
Current nav items:

* Home
* About
* Services
* Portfolio
* Blog
* Contact

### Better structure

* **Home**
* **About**
* **Services**

  * AI & Automation
  * Software Development
  * Consulting
* **Portfolio**
* **Blog**
* **Contact / Let’s Talk**

Make sure:

* Contact is visible at top
* Phone / email are clickable
* Mobile navigation works smoothly

---

## 🧠 I. SEO & Messaging Improvements

Include these layers:

**Homepage meta title**

> AI Automation Consultant | Nicolas Dominici

**Homepage meta description**

> Practical AI automation, workflow systems, and custom software for small tech teams and businesses seeking operational clarity and sustainable scale.

This ties into search patterns like “automation consultant”, “AI automation consultant” etc., which have real demand for consulting service pages([Artdez][2]).

---

## 📅 Step-by-Step Rollout Plan

**Phase 1 — Messaging & Copy**

* Rewrite hero + About
* Update Services copy
* Add case study framework

**Phase 2 — Trust Building**

* Add testimonials
* Add measurable outcomes in portfolio

**Phase 3 — Content Strategy**

* Blog calendar aligned with tools / services
* SEO improvements

**Phase 4 — UX & CTAs**

* Update navigation & CTAs
* Integrate contact forms instead of simple Google Form
