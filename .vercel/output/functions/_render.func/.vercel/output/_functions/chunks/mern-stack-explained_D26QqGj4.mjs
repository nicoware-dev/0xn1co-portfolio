It’s one of the most popular tech stacks for building full-stack JavaScript applications, and for good reason. But what exactly is the MERN stack, and why are so many developers and companies flocking to it?</p>\n<p>In this article, we’re going to break down what each part of the MERN stack does, why it’s a great choice for modern applications, and how you can start building your own full-stack app using these tools.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-mern-stack\">What is the MERN Stack?</h2>\n<p>Let’s start with the basics. MERN is an acronym for four technologies that work together seamlessly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>M</strong>ongoDB – a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.</li>\n<li><strong>E</strong>xpress – a lightweight framework that makes building web applications in Node.js simpler.</li>\n<li><strong>R</strong>eact – a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications (SPAs).</li>\n<li><strong>N</strong>ode.js – a runtime that lets you run JavaScript on the server side.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The best part? MERN lets you work with JavaScript across the entire stack—from the database to the client-side UI—making it incredibly efficient for JavaScript developers.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"a-closer-look-at-each-part-of-the-mern-stack\">A Closer Look at Each Part of the MERN Stack</h2>\n<h3 id=\"mongodb-your-data-backbone\">MongoDB: Your Data Backbone</h3>\n<p>MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which means it doesn’t store data in traditional tables and rows like relational databases do.
