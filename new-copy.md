# 1. HOMEPAGE — FULL COPY REWRITE

## Hero (Above the fold)

**Headline**

> I help small teams and tech-enabled businesses reduce manual work and operational friction through practical AI automation and custom systems.

**Subheadline**

> Clear, reliable automation that removes chaos instead of adding complexity.

**Primary CTA**

> Let’s talk about your challenge

**Secondary CTA (optional)**

> Explore automation decision tools

---

## Short Value Proposition (Below hero)

> Many teams struggle not because they lack tools, but because their processes are unclear, fragmented, or overly manual.
>
> I work with founders and operators to design systems that simplify execution, reduce cognitive load, and make day-to-day operations more predictable.

# 2. ABOUT PAGE — FULL REWRITE

## About Me

> I’m Nicolas, a software engineer and automation consultant focused on building systems that actually work in real operations.
>
> Over the last decade, I’ve worked across engineering, automation, and complex technical environments, helping teams turn messy workflows into clear, reliable systems.
>
> My work today sits at the intersection of software engineering, AI automation, and operational design. I help small teams and tech-enabled businesses reduce manual effort, improve consistency, and scale without introducing unnecessary complexity.
>
> I’m not interested in hype or “AI for the sake of AI.” My focus is on practical automation — the kind that teams trust, maintain, and rely on every day.
>
> If your operation feels heavier than it should, or if automation efforts haven’t delivered the clarity you expected, that’s usually where I can help.

# 3. SERVICES PAGE — RESTRUCTURED & REWRITTEN

## Services

### AI Automation & Operational Systems (Primary)

> I design and implement automation systems that reduce repetitive work, improve consistency, and make operations easier to run.
>
> This includes:
>
> * Workflow automation across tools and teams
> * AI-assisted decision support where it makes sense
> * Reliable integrations and execution logic
> * Systems designed for long-term maintainability
>
> The goal is not more automation — it’s less friction.

---

### Custom Software Development (Secondary)

> When automation is part of a larger system, I build custom software tailored to your operational needs.
>
> This includes internal tools, backend services, integrations, and lightweight platforms designed to support real workflows rather than abstract requirements.

---

### Consulting & Technical Strategy

> For teams that need clarity before implementation, I offer consulting and technical guidance around automation strategy, system design, and process improvement.
>
> This is often used to:
>
> * assess automation readiness
> * identify what should (and should not) be automated
> * reduce risk before committing to builds

# 4. PORTFOLIO / PROJECTS — WHAT TO ADD & HOW TO FRAME THEM

Right now, your portfolio is **too technical and too abstract**.
You need **3–5 business-oriented case studies**, even if anonymized.

## Suggested New Projects / Case Studies

### Case Study 1 — Internal Operations Automation (Anonymized)

**Title**

> Reducing Manual Operations Through Workflow Automation

**Challenge**

> A small team relied on manual coordination across multiple tools, leading to delays and frequent errors.

**Solution**

> Designed and implemented a centralized automation system connecting core tools and standardizing execution logic.

**Impact**

> * Reduced manual operational work by ~40%
> * Improved execution consistency
> * Fewer follow-ups and interruptions

---

### Case Study 2 — AI-Assisted Support Workflow

**Title**

> Improving Support Response Consistency with AI-Assisted Workflows

**Challenge**

> Support processes were inconsistent and heavily dependent on individual judgment.

**Solution**

> Introduced AI-assisted classification and routing combined with rule-based automation.

**Impact**

> * Faster response times
> * More consistent handling
> * Reduced cognitive load for the support team

---

### Case Study 3 — Process Stabilization Before Automation

**Title**

> Why We Didn’t Automate First — And Why That Worked Better

**Challenge**

> A team wanted automation, but their process changed weekly and lacked ownership.

**Solution**

> Focused first on process stabilization and ownership definition before introducing automation.

**Impact**

> * Avoided costly automation failures
> * Created a stable foundation for future automation

---

### Case Study 4 — Multi-Tool Integration System

**Title**

> Connecting Disconnected Tools into a Single Operational System

**Challenge**

> Data and actions were spread across multiple platforms with no clear flow.

**Solution**

> Built a lightweight integration layer to coordinate actions and data across tools.

**Impact**

> * Fewer manual handoffs
> * Clearer operational visibility
> * More reliable execution

---

# 5. TESTIMONIALS — WHAT TO ADD (EVEN IF SHORT)

You don’t need polished marketing testimonials.
You need **credibility signals**.

## Suggested Testimonial Types

### From a Founder

> “Nicolas has a rare ability to cut through complexity and design systems that actually work in day-to-day operations.”

### From a Technical Peer

> “What I value most is his judgment — knowing when automation makes sense and when it doesn’t.”

### From a Client / Collaborator

> “Working with Nicolas brought clarity to our processes before we even touched automation.”

Even 1–2 of these dramatically increase trust.

# 6. BLOG — WHAT TO ADD (ALIGNED WITH INBOUND STRATEGY)

Your blog should **not** be random tech experiments.

## Core Blog Topics to Add

### Automation & Operations

* *How to Decide What to Automate First*
* *When Not to Automate: Common Anti-Patterns*
* *Why Stable Processes Matter More Than AI Tools*
* *The Hidden Cost of Manual Work in Small Teams*
* *Automation Risk and Maintenance: What Teams Underestimate*

### Thought Leadership

* *Automation Is About Reducing Cognitive Load, Not Speed*
* *Why “Easy Automation Wins” Often Fail*

### Special Topic (High Signal)

* *OpenClaw, Moltbot, and the Rise of Autonomous AI Agents: Lessons for Businesses*

### Case-Driven Content

* *What We Fixed Before Automating — And Why It Mattered*
* *How Automation Can Fail Even with Good Tools*

Each blog post should:

* map to a tool or service
* end with a soft CTA (“If this resonates…”)

# 7. CONTACT PAGE — REWRITE

**Headline**

> Let’s Talk About What’s Not Working

**Copy**

> If your operation feels overly manual, inconsistent, or difficult to scale, feel free to reach out.
>
> I’m happy to take a look and help you think through what’s actually worth fixing — with or without automation.
